# Poke The Dots Game
A game I made as part of an [online course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/problem-solving-programming-video-games). The uagame module included in the repository is a module made by the creators of the course.

## How to install
(Instructions for Windows)
1.	Download and install Python 3
2.	Check to make sure PIP is installed
3.	Install pygame by running the following code on Command Prompt  
  `pip3 install pygame`
4.	Download the source code as well as the uagame module file from the repository and run the file named ‘PokeTheDots.py’ just as any other Python script  file

## How to play
The game consists of two dots, one blue and one red, constantly moving throughout the window bouncing off the edges. If the user clicks anywhere on the screen then the two dots teleport to random coordinates in the window. The aim of the game is to get as high a score as possible by making sure that the two dots don’t touch each other.
